        <h2>Interactive figures for Byers &amp; Pringle</h2>
        <p>Instructions for manipulating and zooming in on the figures can be found in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_xS-Kv5_k">this YouTube video.</a><p>
        
      <p>The figure below is on an online and interactive version of Figure 3A with the addition of the arrows from Figure 1. 
        The arrows show the mean distance moved by larvae which return to habitat.
        The colored circles are likelihood of persistence for 600 generations for a neutral introduced species for 
        locations along the coasts of North and South America, and are only shown when the likelihood of persistence is greater than 1%. The grey circles indicate locations where the likelihood
        of peristence is less than 1% but still finite. The larvae drift at the surface and are in the plankton for 22 days and connectivity is calculated for 
        releases from April through June of 2007 to 2023. 
        Fraction calculated for 1000 trial introductions, patch carrying capacity Pmax=1, nintro=10 introductions per trial. </p>
